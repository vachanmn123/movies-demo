    Balbir Singh is a rich industrialist but has no time for his family. His
    son Ranvijay loves him to the core and considers him a superhero. But
    differences develop between them, and Ranvijay is sent to boarding school.
    Years later, he returns to celebrate the 60th birthday of Balbir but is
    asked to leave the house. While leaving, he is surprised to see Gitanjali,
    who has broken her engagement and wants to be with him. They both get
    married in a private ceremony and shift to US. Eight years later, Balbir
    is attacked by unknown assailants but survives. Ranvijay returns with
    Gitanjali and his kids to be with his family, and starts a war with the
    people who tried to assassinate Balbir.

            Ranbir Kapoor is deeply committed to his brash and ugly
            protagonist, but in spite of the movie’s explosive action,
            director Sandeep Reddy Vanga seems more preoccupied with provoking
            outrage than with telling a coherent story.

            Even with Animal's various delusions of grandeur, one thing the
            film definitely doesn’t want to be is fun. It wants to be edgy,
            uncomfortable, and shocking for shock’s sake. It’s defending
            itself against questions no one asked and statements no one made,
            instead of effectively examining topics that clearly vex Vanga.
